# Reproducible Computational Geosciences @ AGILE 2017

Pre-conference workshop at [AGILE 2017](https://agile-online.org/index.php/home-2017)

## About

Reproducible research (RR) gains more attention each year with prominent papers, editorials
and blog posts as journals, researchers and funders drive forward the agenda on open
science. But still the majority of papers analyzing data, including diverse and often unique
spatio-temporal observations, are not accompanied by complete materials (data, methods,
complete results) to reproduce the methodology and computations, so that anyone can
reproduce the findings.

In this half-day workshop we introduce the topic in the GIScience domain with a focus on
computational reproducibility.

Contributions on the topics

- lessons learned and best practices on RR, incl. previously published examples
- reports on reproducibility studies
- challenges of RR/open science
- tools and workflows supporting computational RR
- education in RR methods
- archives and repositories
- legal aspects of RR (privacy, licenses, terms of service)

are welcome.

Workshop papers (< 1000 words) must be submitted via pull request to the GitHub repository https://github.com/o2r-project/agile-2017 or via email to daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de.
Selected papers will be invited for presentation at the workshop.

## Schedule

TBA

## Workshop agenda

- Introduction/Welcome
- Invited talks (1-2, arount 15 minutes each)
- Talks (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

## Submissions

[Fork the workshop repository](https://github.com/o2r-project/agile-2017#fork-destination-box) and create a new [Markdown]() document named `first_authors_last_name>.md` in the directory `submissions`. Then [create a pull request]().
Feedback will be given in the pull request discussion. Accepted papers will be merged and published on the website.
