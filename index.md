# Reproducible Geosciences Discussion Forum @ AGILE 2017

Pre-conference workshop at the [20th AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science](https://agile-online.org/index.php/home-2017), Wageningen, **May 9 2017** (afternoon, see [conference programme](https://agile-online.org/index.php/programme-2017/detailed-programme-2017))

<div style="font-style: italic; border: 1px solid red; padding: 1em;"><span style="color: red;">UPDATE:</span> The workshop programme was updated to a discussion forum towards writing a position paper.
This is a reaction to few submissions and the realisation the introduction of RR at AGILE requires a different approach.
Join the discussion to prepare AGILE for the future!</div>

## About

Reproducible research (RR) gains more attention each year with prominent papers, editorials and blog posts as journals, researchers and funders drive forward the agenda on open science.
But still the majority of papers analysing data, including diverse and often unique spatio-temporal observations, are not accompanied by complete materials (data, code/methods, complete results) so that anyone can reproduce the findings.
In this workshop we want to discuss in an informal setting if and how RR is relevant for the AGILE organization as well as conference.

Questions to get our discussion started are:

- How many papers at AGILE use computational methods or analyse datasets?
- Which [AGILE member labs](https://agile-online.org/index.php/community/members) have reproducibility on their teaching agendas and practice it in their research?
- Will the AGILE conference prevail without reproducibility studies and special credit for replications, open science, open code, open data, and RR?

The workshop's goal is to create an outline for a position paper _"Reproducible Research for the future of AGILE"_ to be submitted to AGILE 2018.

If you are interested in putting RR on the agenda for the AGILE community we look forward to welcome your ideas at the workshop.

<s>Workshop papers (< 1000 words) must be submitted via pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/o2r-project/agile-2017">workshop's GitHub repository</a>, see instructions below. Selected papers will be invited for presentation at the workshop.</s>
