## 3. Abstract

Reproducibility and replicability of research gains more attention each year across many domains, some of which even struggle with a "reproducibility crisis".
However, at AGILE conferences, the topic is underrepresented.
We have found that none of the last years candidates for best papers (short & full papers) provided sufficient information (instructions, data, and code) to be reproduced independently by a third party.
In this workshop we would like to plant a seed in the AGILE community by introducing newcomers to the world of reproducible research and give hands-on guidance on how to increase the degree of reproducibility for their research.

Participants are required to register beforehand via email to daniel.nuest@uni-muenster.de.
If possible they should bring their own analysis with them, be it a laptop with their own software and workflow documentation or a storage device with data and code.
The planned agenda for the day is as

- morning
  - introduction to reproducible research: relevant literature, challenges, and solutions
  - discussion: RR at AGILE 2020
- afternoon: reproduce brought along research

## 4. Short description of the intended length (half or full day) and the format of the workshop

Full day workshop with a mixture of lecture and discussion in the morning, and hands-on practical workshop in the afternoon.

## 5. Brief statement of the relevance of the workshop for AGILE

This workshop is a follow-up to last year's successful introduction of reproducible research at AGILE.
The relevance of Open Science and reproducible research has not changed!
On try contrary, the overarching challenge to develop guidelines and feature examples for the AGILE community still prevails.

While the workshop format had to be adjusted last year as the submissions were too low for the then planned format, the topic was taken up during the conference in many conversations and by presenters during their talks.
This year, the organizing committee is strengthened further and wants to keep the slow but steady pace to establish reproducible research practices at the AGILE conference.
The workshop's hands-on approach is a complementary feature to the list of AGILE workshops and most relevant to all of AGILE's attendees, but especially for young researchers just beginning to establish their way of practicing science.
