## 3. Abstract

Reproducibility and replicability of research gains more attention each year across many domains, some of which even struggle with a "reproducibility crisis".
However, at AGILE conferences, the topic is underrepresented.
Recent research (submitted to AGILE 2017) found that none of the last years nominees for best papers (both short & full papers) provided sufficient information (i.e. instructions, data, and code) to be reproduced independently by a third party.
In this workshop we would like to plant a seed in the AGILE community by introducing newcomers to the world of reproducible research and give hands-on guidance on how to increase the degree of reproducibility for their work.

The planned agenda for the half-day workshop (4 hours in total) is as follows:

1. Introduction to reproducible research: relevant literature, challenges, and solutions (lecture) [15 min.]
2. Reproducibility at AGILE (and its member labs) today and tomorrow (presentation, discussion) [45 min.]
3. Hands-on reproducible research [150 mins. including breaks]
    - Reproducible paper with R Markdown
    - Reproducible lab notebook in Python with Jupyter
    - Python scripting with ArcGIS
    - Python scripting with QGIS
4. Summary & Feedback [30 min.]

Participants are required to register until **April 22 2018** (parallel to end of early registration for conference) via [opening a GitHub issue on the workshop repository]().
The registration must include (i) a short description of experience in the technologies of the hands-on sessions, (ii) a summary of previously conducted computational work, ideally including the actual data and code as references, (iii) motivation or plans for future computer-based research, and (iv) preferred hands-on session.

In case of a high number of publications, participants may be selected based on the submitted material.
Participants must bring their own computers and be prepared to install software before the workshop.

The number and topics of hands-on sessions depend on room availability and participants' interests and will be announced on _May 15 2018_.

## 4. Short description of the intended length (half or full day) and the format of the workshop

Half day workshop with a mixture of lecture, hands-on practical work, and discussion.

## 5. Brief statement of the relevance of the workshop for AGILE

This workshop is a follow-up to last year's successful introduction of reproducible research at AGILE.
The relevance of Open Science and reproducible research has not changed!
On the contrary, the overarching challenge to develop guidelines and feature examples for the AGILE community still prevails.

While the workshop format had to be adjusted last year as the submissions were too low for the then planned format, the topic was taken up during the conference in many conversations and by presenters during their talks.
This year, the organizing committee is strengthened further and wants to keep the steady pace to establish reproducible research practices at the AGILE conference.

The workshop's hands-on approach is a complementary feature to the list of AGILE workshops and most relevant to all of AGILE's attendees, but especially valuable for early career scientists, who are just beginning to establish their way of practicing science.

## 6. What is the approximate number of expected participants?

## 8. Additional information about previous workshops, if held.

http://o2r.info/agile-2017/

## 9. Expected resources needed

- one lecture room
- two additional break-out rooms for hands-on sessions
- internet connection for all participants
- digital projector (in all rooms)
- coffee
- flip charts or whiteboard, 1 per room

## 10. Other information

The workshop potentially targets the same audience, i.e. people interested in open science and data science, as another workshop proposal on research data management.
For people interested in both topics, it would be very welcome to schedule the workshops after each other: research data in the morning, and writing the reproducible publication in the afternoon.
