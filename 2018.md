# Reproducible Research Publications @ AGILE 2018

Workshop at the [21st AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science](http://agile-online.org/index.php/conference/conference-2018), Lund, Sweden on Tuesday June 12 at 14:30 CEST.

The workshop introduces interested scientists and developers to the concepts of reproducible research and give hands-on guidance on how to increase the degree of reproducibility for their own work.
Participants explore the practical principles of reproducible papers by reproducing a provided real-world scientific publication.

## Workshop report

to be published

## Agenda

1. Introduction to reproducible research ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A41_Jd_saP4n_Vm84In3onRJkA4M_95EjWqJiSrl4s8/edit?usp=sharing))
2. Reproducibility at AGILE today ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Psz_tv6fGMzi2YSSPaYFrseoSzEmNa3p1epP7LEDVQg/edit?usp=sharing))
3. Hands-on reproducible research
4. Reproducibility at AGILE tomorrow

## Resources

- We take notes at [**https://epad.ifgi.de/p/reproducible-agile-2018**](https://epad.ifgi.de/p/reproducible-agile-2018)
- The material for reproducing the paper is at [https://github.com/nuest/reproducible-research-and-giscience](https://github.com/nuest/reproducible-research-and-giscience)

## Original call for participation

### Agenda

1. Introduction to reproducible research: relevant literature, challenges, and solutions (lecture) [15 min.]
2. Reproducibility at AGILE today (presentation) [15 min.]<br />
Take a look at this [recent pre-print](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.26561v1) if you want to learn more:
[![]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/peerj-preprint-agile-rr.png)](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.26561v1)
3. Hands-on reproducible research [120 mins. including breaks, two break-out sessions]
    - **Goal:** Reproducing a paper with either _R_ or _Python_ code
        - Participants make first-hand experiences in trying to reproduce a prepared computational analysis from a real paper
        - Transform a "typical" publication into a reproducible document
        - Publish the analysis in a research data repository
    - **Skills:** Tools for creating reproducible documents (literate programming wit R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook), scripted geospatial workflows for GIS
4. Reproducibility at AGILE tomorrow (discussion, presentation) & Feedback [30 min.]

### Registration

Participants are required to on the AGILE conference website.

In addition participants must submit some information to the [workshop repository on GitHub](https://github.com/o2r-project/reproducible-agile) by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/o2r-project/reproducible-agile/issues/new) **until May 27 2018**.

The issue must include

1. preferred hands-on session (_R_ or _Python_),
1. a short description of experience in R and/or Python
1. a summary of computational work, if available with references to published papers, data or code, and
1. plans for future computer-based research.

Basic skills in the selected programming language are required to participate in the workshop (e.g. practical experiences as part of a research project) - please get in touch if you are unsure!

In case of a high number of publications, participants may be selected based on the submitted material.
Participants must bring their own computers and be prepared to install software _before and at_ the workshop.

The number and topics of hands-on sessions depend on room availability and participants' interests.
They will be announced on _May 15 2018_.

## Code of Conduct

> To ensure a welcoming environment for all, we require everyone participating in the workshop to conform to the Code of Conduct given below.
> This code applies to all spaces related to the workshop including, but not limited to, workshop venue, emails, shared documents, and code repositories.
> We strongly recommend that anyone running workshops or classes of any kind choose and publish a similar code so that everyone will know what is expected of them and what to do when those expectations are not met.

You can report Code of Conduct violations anonymously via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8eXwMHpHQIbj4BptImIDCDlBgRZeq1mEtKBEglxpoIIkpZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) or in person to Rusne Sileryte or Carlos Granell (who have access to the anonymous reports besides Daniel Nüst).

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
However, we recognize that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged.
Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort.
Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions.
Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behavior in our community, regardless of intent.
Prohibited harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above;
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation;
- the display of sexual or violent images;
- unwelcome sexual attention;
- non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact;
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications;
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm;
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop; and
- publication of private communication without consent.

Behavior not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment.
The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.
All interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

_[This code of conduct is based on a CoC for ["Hot to teach programming (and Other Things)](http://third-bit.com/teaching/conduct.html) by Greg Wilson, which in turn is based on that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.]_
